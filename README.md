# Custom Code Bookmark

## Purpose

Welcome to my **custom code bookmark repository**! This is where I stash my WordPress tweaks because, let’s face it, my memory isn’t what it used to be (short-term memory issues, you know how it is). Instead of relying on my brain, I rely on this handy little repo to store those precious snippets.

## What's Inside?

- **Initial Random Post Views**: Want your WordPress posts to look like they’ve already been read by some secret internet audience? This code sets a random view count between **512 and 768** for every new post, because nothing says "popular" like some good old fake views!

## Quick Reference

### Initial Random Post Views

This custom snippet automatically sets a random number of views for every new post. It’s like giving your post a little head start before anyone actually reads it. Perfect for adding that touch of mystery and success right out of the gate.

**Relevant File**: 
- You’ll find this magical code sitting comfortably in your theme’s `functions.php` file.

**Why this exists**: I have the memory of a goldfish, so this repo is here to help me keep track of my WordPress customizations without needing to dig through my brain (or worse, my browser history).
